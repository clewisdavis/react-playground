# React Main Concepts Notes

My notes from going through the [main concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) section of documentation.

The smallest React example looks like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
ReactDOM
    .creatRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
    .render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

- It displays a heading saying "hello world" on the page.
- Check out this [code pen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/MjrdWg?editors=1010) and play around with the page.

## How to read this guide

From this guide, we will go over the building blocks of React apps: elements and compnents. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

This is a compliment guide to the [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://github.com/clewisdavis/react-playground/blob/main/React-Notes.md).

First, look at a step-by-step guid on main React concepts. Every section build on teh knowledge in earlier sections. You can learn most of React by reading the "main concepts" guide chapters in teh order they appear.

## Knowledge Level Assumptions

React is a JS library, and assume you have some basic understanding of the JS language. You can brush up on your [JS on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript). You don't want to be learning JS and React at the same time.

## Intro to JSX

- Consider this variable declaration:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
```

- It is called JSX, and a syntax extension to JS.
- It's recommneded using in React to describe what the UI should look like.
- JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JS.

- JSX produces React elements. Below are the basics of JSX and how to get started.

### Why JSX?

- React embraces the fact rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, state changes over time and how data is prepared for display.
- Instead of artificially seperating technologies by putting markup adn logic in seperate files. react
- React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called "components" that contain both.
- React doesn't require using JSX, btu most peopel find it helpful as a visual aid hwen wroking tih the UI inside the JS code.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX

- In this example, we declare a variable called `name` and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces.

```JAVASCRIPT
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
```

- You can put any valid JS expression inside the curly braces in JSX.
- For example, `2 + 2`, or `formatName(user)` are al valid JS expressions.

- In the example below, we embed the result of callign a JS function, `formatName(user)` into an `<h1>` element.
  
```JAVASCRIPT
funciton formatName(user) {
    return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
    firstName: 'Harper',
    lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
    <h1>
      Hello, {formatName(user)}!
    </h1>
)
```

### JSX is an Expression Too

- After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JS function calls and evaluate to JS objects.
- This mean you can use JSX inside of `if` statment and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept as arguments and return it from functions:

```JAVASCRIPT
function getGreeting(user) {
    if (user) {
        return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
    }
    return <h1>Hello, stranger.</h1>
}
```

### Specifying Attributes with JSX

- You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <a href="https://www.reactjs.org"> link </a>;
```

- You may also use curly braces to embed a JS expressoin in an attribute:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```

- Don't put quotes aroudn curly braces when embedding a JS expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.

- **warning** Since JSX is closer to JS than to HTML and React DOM uses `camelCase` property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. For example `class` becomes `className` in JSX and `tabindex` becomes `tabIndex`.

### Specifying Children in JSX

- If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>` like XML:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

- JSX tags may contain children:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

### JSX Prevents Injection Attacks

- It is sav eto embed user inptu in JSX:

```JAVASCRIPT
const title = response. potentiallyMaliciousInput;
//This is save:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;
```

- By default, React DOM `escapes` any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. This it ensures that you can neve rinject anything that not explicitly written in you app.
- Everything is converted to a string befor ebeing rendered. This helps prevent XSS cross site scripting attacks.

### JSX Represents Objects

- Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls.
- These two examples are identical:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = (
    <h1 className="greeting">
      Hello, world!
    </h1>
)
```

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = React.createElement(
    'h1',
    {className: 'greeting'},
    'Hello, world!'
);
```

- React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug free code but essentially creates an object like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

- These objects are called "React elements". Youc an think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen.
- react reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

- We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the next section.
- **TIP** recommend using the [Babel language definition](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/editors) for your editor

## Rendering Elements

- Let's say there is a `<div>` somewhere in your HTML file.

```HTML
<div id="root"></div>
```

- We call this a "root" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
- Apps built with just React usually have a single root DOM node.
- **If you are integrating React into an existing app**, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

- To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to `ReactDOM.createRoot()`, then pass the React element to `root.render()`

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById('root')
);
root.render(element);
```

- Try this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/edyBaE?editors=1010)

### Updating the Rendered Element

- React element are immutable (unchangeable). Once you create an elemtn, you can't change it's children or attributes.
- And element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time

- With our knowledge so far, the only wayt o update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to `root.renter()`.
- Like tis ticking clock example:

```JAVASCRIPT
//first pass the DOM element to .createRoot() method
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);

function tick() {
    const element = (
        <div>
          <h1>Hello world!</h1>
          <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
        </div>
    );
    root.render(elemnt);
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

- Check out the [codePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwoJeZ?editors=1010)

- NOTE: In practice, most React apps only call `root.render()` once. In upcoming sectoins we will learn how such ode gets encapsulated into [`stateful components`](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

### React Only Updates What's Necessary

- React DOM compares the elements and it's children to the previous one, and only applies DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
- You can see for yourself by looking at the [last exampl](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwoJeZ?editors=1010)e in the browser tools

- Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents hae changed gets updated by React DOM.

- In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.

## Components and Props

- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
- **Conceptually, components are like JS functions.** They accept arbitrary inputs (called props) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Function and Class Components

- The simplest way to define a component is to write a JS function:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

- This function si a valid React component because it accepts a single prop (short for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element.
- We call such components "function components" because they are literally JS functions.

- You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

- The above examples are equivalent in React's point of view.
- Function and Class components both have some additional features that we wil discuss in the future sections.

### Rendering a Component

- Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <div />;
```

- However, elements can also represent user-defined components:

```JAVASCRIPT
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

- When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object "props".
- For example; this code renders "Hello, Sara" on the page:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(element);
```

- Recap of what's going on in this example:

1. We call `root.render()` with the `<Welcome name="Sara" />` element.
2. React calls the `Welcome` component with `{name: 'Sara'}` as the props.
3. Our `Welcome` component returns a `<h1>Hello, Sare<h1>` element as the result.
4. react DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>`

- **NOTE: Always start component names with a capital letter.**

### Composing Components

- Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us us the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, form, dialog a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

- For example we can create an `App` component that renders `Welcome` many times:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Audrey" />
      <Welcome name="Alex" />
      <Welcome name="Arden" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

- Typically, new React apps have a single `App` component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom up with a small component like `Button` and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

### Extracting Components

- Don't be afraid to split components into smaller components.
- For example, thsi `Comment` component:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
       <img className="Avatar"
        src={props.author.avatarUrl}
        alt={props.author.name}
       />
       <div className+"UserInfo-name">
        {props.author.name}
       </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- It accepts `author` (an object), `text` (a string), and `date` (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.
- This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. We can extract a few components from it.

- First we extract `Avatar`:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    />
  );
}
```

- The `Avatar` doesn't need to knwo that is is being rendered inside a `Comment`. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: `user` rather than `author`.

- **We recommend naming props from the components own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.**

- Now we can simplify `Comment` a tiny bit:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
       <Avatar user={props.author} />
       <div className+"UserInfo-name">
        {props.author.name}
       </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Next we wil extract a `UserInto` component that renders an `Avatar` next to the user's name:

```JAVASCRIPT
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
      <Avatar user={props.user} />
      <div className="UserInfo-name">
        {props.user.name}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- This lets us simplify `Comment` even further:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps.
- A good rule of thumb is that is a part of your UI is used several times (`Button`, `Panel`, `Avatar`), or is complex enough on it's own (`App`, `FeedStory`, `Comment`) it is a good candidate to be extracted to separate component.

## Props are Read-Only

- Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify it's own props. Consider this `sum` function:

```JAVASCRIPT
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- Such functions are called "pure" because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result from the same inputs.

- In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```JAVASCRIPT
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```

- React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule.

- **All React components must act like pure function with respect to their props.**

- Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section we will introduce the new concept of state.
- State allows React components to change their output over time in response to the users actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.

## State and Lifecycle

- This section introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component.
- You can find a [detailed API reference here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)

- Consider the ticking clock example from one of the [previous sections](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#updating-the-rendered-element).
- In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI.
- We call `root.render()` to change the rendered output:

```JAVASCRIPT
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementByID('root'));

function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  root.render(element);
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

- [CodePen Reference](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gwoJeZ?editors=0010)

- In this section, we will learn hwo to make the `Clock` component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up it's own timer and update itself every second.

- We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:

```JAVASCRIPT
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementByID('root'));

function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function tick() {
  root.render(<Clock date={new Date()} />);
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

- However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the `Clock` sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the `Clock`.

- Ideally we want to write this once and have th `Clock` update itself:

```JAVASCRIPT
root.render(<Clock />);
```

- To implement this, we need to add "state" tot he `Clock` component.

- State is similar to props, btu it is private and fully controlled by the component.

## Converting a Function to a Class

- You can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:

1. Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), with the same name, that extends `React.Component`
2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

```JAVASCRIPT
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/zKRGpo?editors=0010)

- `Clock` isi now defined as a class rather than a function.

- The `render` method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render `<Clock />` into the asme DOM node, only a single instance of the `Clock` class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.

## Adding Local State to a Class

- We will move the `date` form props to state in three steps:

1. Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.date` in teh `render()` method:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>hello, world</h1>
        <h2>it is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

2. Add a [class constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#constructor) that assigns the initial `this.state`:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>hello, world</h1>
        <h2>it is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

- Note how we pass `props` to the base constructor:

```JAVASCRIPT
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {date: new Date()};
}
```

- Class components should always call the base constructor with `props`.

3. Remove the `date` prop from the `<Clock />` element:

```JAVASCRIPT
root.render(<Clock />);
```

- We will add teh timer code back to the component itself.
- The result looks like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>hello, world</h1>
        <h2>it is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clock />);
```

- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/KgQpJd?editors=0010)

- Next, we will make the `Clock` set up its own timer and update itself every second.

## Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

- In apps with many components, it's very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

- We want to set up a timer whenever the `Clock` is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called "mounting" in Rect.

- We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the `Clock` is removed. This is called "unmounting" in React.

- We can declare special methods on teh component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {

  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>hello, world</h1>
        <h2>it is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clock />);
```

- **These methods are called "lifecycle methods".**

- The `componentDidMount()` method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:

```JAVASCRIPT
componentDidMount() {
  this.timerID = setInterval(
    () => this.tick(),
    1000
  );
}
```

- Note hwo we save the timer ID right on `this` (`this.timerID`).

- While `this.props` is set up by React itself and `this.state` has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually fi you need to store something that doesn't participate int he data flow (like a timer ID).

- We will tear down the timer in the `componentWilUnmount()` lifecycle method:

```JAVASCRIPT
componentWillUnmount() {
  clearInterval(ths.timerID);
}
```

- Finally we will implement a method called `tick()` that the `Clock` component will run every second.

- It will use `this.setState()` to schedule updates tot he component local state:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(ths.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>hello, world</h1>
        <h2>it is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Clock />);
```

- Try on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/amqdNr?editors=0010)
- Now the clock ticks every second.

- Let's quickly recap what's going on and the order in which methods are called:

1. When `<Clock />` is passed to `root.render()`, React calls the constructor of the `Clock` component. Since `Clock` needs to display the current time, it initializes `this.state` with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.
2. React then calls the `Clock` component's `render()` method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates teh DOM to match the `Clock`'s render output.
3. When the `Clock` output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. Inside it, the `Clock` component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component's `tick()` method once a second.
4. Every second the browser calls the `tick()` method. Inside it, the `Clock` component schedules a UI update by calling `setState()` with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the `setState()` call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the `render()` method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, `this.state.date` int he `render()` method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React update the DOM accordingly.
5. If the `Clock` component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.

## Using State Correctly

- There are three things you should know about `setState()`.

### Do not modify state directly

- For example, this will not re-render a component:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
```

- Instead, use `setState()`:

```JAVASCRIPT
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
```

- The only place where you can assign `this.state` is the constructor.

### State Updates May be Asynchronous

- React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance.
- because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you shoudl not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

- For example, this code may fail to update teh counter:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
})
```

- To fix it, use a second form of `setState()` that accepts a **function rather than an object**.
- That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Correct, arrow function
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```

- We use an arrow function, but it also works with regular functions:

```JAVASCRIPT
// Correct, regular function
this.setState(function(state, props) {
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
});
```

### State Updates are Merged

- When you call `setState()`, React merges the object you provide into the current state.

- For example, your state may contain several independent variables:

```JAVASCRIPT
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {
    posts: [],
    comments: []
  }
}
```

- Then you can update them independently with separate `setState()` calls:

```JAVASCRIPT
componentDidMount() {
  fetchPosts().then(response => {
    this.setState({
      posts: response.posts
    });
  });

  fetchComments().then(response => {
    this.setState({
      comments: response.comments
    })
  })
}
```

- The merging is shallow, so `this.setState({comments})` leaves `this.state.posts` intact, but completely replaces `this.state.comments`.

### The Date Flows Down

- Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn't care whether it is defined as a function or a class.

- This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.

- A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:

```JAVASCRIPT
<FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />
```

- The `FormattedDate` component would receive teh `date` in its props and wouldn't know whether it came from the `Clock`'s state, form the `Clock`'s props, or typed by hand:

```JAVASCRIPT
function FormattedDate(props) {
  return <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>;
}
```

- Check out the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/zKRqNB?editors=0010)

- This is commonly called a "top-down" or "unidirectional" data flow.
- Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any date or UI derived from that state can only affect components "below" them in the tree.

- If you imagine a component tree as a **waterfall of props**, each component's state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.

- To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an `App` component that renders three `<Clock>`'s:

```JAVASCRIPT
function App() {
  return {
    <div>
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
    </div>
  }
}
```

- Try on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/vXdGmd?editors=0010)

- Each `Clock` sets up its own timer and updates independently.

- In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time.
- You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.

## Handling Events

- Handling events with react elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

  - React events are named using cameCase, rather than lowercase.
  - With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

- For example, the HTML:

```HTML
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

- is slightly differ in React:

```JAVASCRIPT
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

- Another difference is that you cannot return `false` to prevent default behavior in React.
- You must call `preventDefault` explicitly.
- For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write:

```HTML
<form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

In React, this could instead be:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```

- Here, `e` is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don't need to worry about cross-browser compatibility.
- React events do not work exactly the same as native events.See the [SyntheticEvent](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) reference guide to learn more.

- When using React, you generally **don't need to call** `addEventListener` to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created.
- Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

- When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class
- For example, this `Toggle` component renders a button that lets the user toggle between "ON" and "OFF" states:

```JAVASCRIPT
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make 'this' work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button conClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      </button>
    )
  }


}
```

- See on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/xEmzGg?editors=0010)

- You have to be careful about the meaning of `this` in JSX callbacks.
- In JS, class methods are not [bound](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) by default.
- **If you forget to bind** `this.handleClick` and pass it to `onClick`, `this` will be `undefined` when the functionality is actually called.

- This is not React-specific behavior; it is part of [how functions work in JavaScript](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/01/understanding-javascript-function-prototype-bind/).
- Generally, if you refer to a method without `()` after it, such as `onClick={this.handleClick}`, **you should bind that method.**

- If calling `bind` annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this.
- If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:

```JAVASCRIPT
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures 'this' is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click Me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

- This syntax is enabled by default in [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- If you aren't using class fields syntax, you can sue an arrow function in the callback:

```JAVASCRIPT
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {

  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures 'this' is bound within the handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick)}>
        Click Me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

- The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the `LoggingButton` renders.
- In most cases thi is fine. however, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering.
- We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

- Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler.
- For example, if `id` is the row ID, either of the following would work:

```JAVASCRIPT
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this.id)}>Delete Row</button>
```

- The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively.

- In both cases, the `e` argument representing the Rect event will be passed as a second argument after the ID.
- With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, ut with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.

## Conditional Rendering

- In React, you can create distinct component that encapsulate behavior you need. Then you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your app.

- **Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JS.**
- Use JS operator like [if](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) or the [conditional operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

- Consider these two components:

```JAVASCRIPT
function UserGreeting(props) {
  return (
    <h1>Welcome Back</h1>
  )
}

function GuestGreeting(props) {
  return (
    <h1>Please sign up.</h1>
  )
}
```

- We will create a `Greeting` component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  }
  return <GuestGreeting />;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  // Try changing to isLoggedIn={true};
  <Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

- Try on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/edbMaP?editors=0011)
- This example renders a different greeting depending on the value of `isLoggedIn` prop.

### Element Variables

- You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part fo the component while the rest of the output doesn't change.

- Consider these two new components representing Logout and Login buttons:

```JAVASCRIPT
function LoginButton(props) {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      Login
    </button>
  );
}

function LogoutButton(props) {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      Logout
    </button>
  )
}
```

- In the example below, we will create a [stateful component](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-local-state-to-a-class) called `LoginControl`.

- It will render either `<LoginButton>` or `<LogoutButton />` depending on it's current state. It will also render a `<Greeting />` from teh previous example:

```JAVASCRIPT
class LoginControl extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleLoginClick = this.handleLoginClick.bind(this);
    this.handleLogoutClick = this.handleLogoutClick.bind(this);
    this.state = {isLoggedIn: false};
  }

  handleLoginClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: true});
  }

  handleLogoutClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: false});
  }

  render() {
    const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
    let button;
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      button = <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />;
    } else {
      button = <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn} />
        {button}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.renter(
  <LoginControl />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

- Try it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/QKzrgB?editors=0010)

- While declaring a variable and using an `if` statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax. There are a few ways to inline conditions in JSX, explained below.

### Inline If with Logical && Operator

- You may embed expression in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces.
This includes the JS logical `&&` [operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND). It can be hand for conditionally including an element:

```JAVASCRIPT
funciton Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}

const messages = ['React', 'Re: react', 'Re:Re: React'];
ReactDOM.render(
  <Mailbox unreadMessages={messages} />,
  document.getElementById('root');
);
```

- Try it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ozJddz?editors=0010)

- It works because in JS, `true && expression` always evaluates to `expression`, and `false && expression` always evaluates to `false`.

- Therefore, if the condition is `true`, the element right after `&&` will appear in the output. If it is `false`, React will skip it.

- Note that returning a falsy expression wil still cause the element after `&&` to be skipped but will return the falsy expression.
- In the example below, `<div>0</div>` will be returned by the render method.

```JAVASCRIPT
render() {
  const count = 0;
  return (
    <div>
      {count && <h1>Messages: {count}</h1>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator

- Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JS conditional operator [condition ? true : false](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

- In the example below, we use it to conditionally render a small block of text.

```JAVASCRIPT
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
    </div>
  )
}
```

It can also be used for larger expressions although it is less obvious what's going on:

```JAVASCRIPT
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn
        ? <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />
        : <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />
      }
    </div>
  )
}
```

- Just like in JS, it is up to you to choose an appropriate style based on waht you and your team consider more readable.
- **Also remember that whenever conditions become too complex**, it might be a good time to [extract a component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components).

### Preventing Component from Rendering

- In rare cases yo might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return `null` instead of it's render output.

- Example, the `WarningBanner />` is rendered depending on teh value of the prop called `warn`. If the value of the prop is `false`, then the component does not render:

```JAVASCRIPT
function WarningBanner(props) {
  if (!props.warn) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="warning">
      Warning!
    </div>
  );
}

class Page extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {showWarning: true};
    this.handleToggleClick = this.handleToggleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleToggleClick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      showWarning: !state.showWarning
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <WarningBanner war={this.state.showWarning} />
        <button onClick={this.handleToggleClick}>
          {this.state.showWarning ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Page />
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

- Try on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/Xjoqwm?editors=0010)

- Turning `null` from a components `render` method deos not affect the firing of the component's lifecycle methods. For instance `componentDidUpdate` will still be called.

## Lists and Keys

- First, let's review how you transform lists in JS.

- Given the code below, we use the [map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) function to take an array of `numbers` and double their values. We assign the new array returned by `map()` to the variable `doubled` and log it:

```JAVASCRIPT
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

- Ths code logs `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]` to the console.
- In React, transforming arrays into lists of [elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) is nearly identical.

### Rendering Multiple Components

- You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces `{}`.

- Below, we loop through the `numbers` array using the JS `map()` function. We return a `<li>` for each item. Finaly, we assign the resulting array of elements to `listItems`

```JAVASCRIPT
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) => 
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```

- Then, we can include the entire `listItems` array inside a `<ul>` element:

```JAVASCRIPT
<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```

- Try on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/GjPyQM?editors=0011)

- This code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5.

### Basic List Component

- Usually you would render lists inside a component.

- We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of `numbers` and outputs a list of elements.

```JAVASCRIPT
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />
);
```

- When you run this code, you will be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items.
- A "key" is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We will discuss why it's important int he next section.

- Let's assign a `key` to our list items inside `numbers.map()` and fix the missing key issue.

```JAVASCRIPT
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />
);
```

- Try it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/jMXYRR?editors=0011)

### Keys

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

```JAVASCRIPT
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listITems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```

- The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item amoung its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:

```JAVASCRIPT
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
 <li key={todo.id}>
   {todo.text}
 <li>
)
```

- When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

```JAVASCRIPT
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
// Ony do this if items have no stable IDs
 <li key={index}>
   {todo.text}
 <li>
)
```

- We don't recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change.
- This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
- Check out Pokorny's article for an [in-depth explanation](https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318) on the negative impact of using an index as a key.

- Also, an [in-depth explanation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children) about why keys are necessary if you are intersted in learning more.

### Extracting Components with Keys

- Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.

- For example, if you extract a `ListItem` component, you should keep the key on the `<ListItem />` elements in the array rather than on the `<li>` element in the `ListItem` itself.

- Example: Incorrect Key Usage

```JAVASCRIPT
function ListItem(props) {
  const value = props.value;
  return (
    // Wrong, There is no need to specify the key here:
    <li key={value.toString()}>
      {value}
    </li>
  );
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Wrong, the key should have been specified here:
    <ListItem value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- Example: Correct Key Usage

```JAVASCRIPT
function ListItem(props) {
  const value = props.value;
  return (
    // Correct, There is no need to specify the key here:
    <li>
      {props.value}
    </li>
  );
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct, Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- Try it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/ZXeOGM?editors=0010)

- **A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the `map()` call needs keys.**

## Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings

- Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don't need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:

```JAVASCRIPT
function Blog(props) {
  const sidebar = (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={post.id}>
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
  const content = props.posts.map((post) =>
    <div key={post.id}>
      <h3>{post.title}</h3>
      <p>{post.title}</p>
    </div>
  );
  return (
    <div>
      {sidebar}
        <hr/>
      {content}
    </div>
  );
}

const posts = [
  {id: 1, title: 'Hello World', content: 'Welcome to learning React!'},
  {id: 2, title: 'Installation', content: 'You can install React from npm.'}
];

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Blog posts={posts} />);
```

- Try on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/NReYGN?editors=0010)

- Keys serve as a hint to React but they dont' get passed to your components.
- If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:

```JAVASCRIPT
const content = posts.map((post) =>
  <Post
    key={post.id}
    id={post.id}
    title={post.title}
  />
);
```

- With the example above, the `Post` component can read `props.id`, but not `props.key`.

### Embedding map() in JSX

- In the examples above we declared a separate `listItems` variable and included it in JSX:

```JAVASCRIPT
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <ListItem key={number.toString()}
            value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- JSX allow [embedding any expression](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx) in curly braces so we could inline the `map()` result:

```JAVASCRIPT
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <ListItems key={number.toString()} 
                   value={number} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

- Try it on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/BLvYMB?editors=0010)

- Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused.
- Like in JS, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability.
- Keep in mind that if the `map()` body is too nested, it might be a good time to [extract a component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#extracting-components).

## Forms

- HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTL accepts a single name:

```JAVASCRIPT
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

- This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form.
- If you want this behavior in React, it just works.
- But in most cases, it's convenient to have a JS function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form.
- The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called "controlled components".

### Controlled Components

- In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintin their own state and update it based on user input.
- In React, mutable state is typicaly kept in the state property of components, and only updated with [setState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate).

- We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.
- An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component.

- For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:

```JAVASCRIPT
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}

- Since the `value` attribute is set on our form element, teh displayed value will always be `this.staate.value`, making the React state the source of truth.
- Since `handleChange` runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

- With a controlled component, the input's value is always driven by the React state.
- While this mean you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

### The textarea Tag

- In HTML, a `<textarea>` element defines its text by tis children:

```HTML
<textarea>
  Hello there, this is the text area.
</textarea>
```

- In React, a `<textarea>` uses a `<value>` attribute instead. this way, a form using a `<textarea>` can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single line input:

```JAVASCRIPT
class EssayForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(super);
    this.state = {
      value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'
    };

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event:target.value});
  }

  handleSUbmit(event) {
    alert('An essay was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Essay:
          <textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

- Notice that `this.state.value` is initialized in the constructor, sot hat the text area starts off with some text in it.

### The select Tag

- In HTML, `<select>` creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop down list of flavors:

```HTML
<select>
  <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
  <option value="lime">Lime</option>
  <option selected value="coconut">Coconut</option>
  <option value="mango">Mango</option>
</select>
```

- Note that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the `selected` attribute.
- React, instead of using the `selected` attribute, uses a `value` attribute on the root `select` tag.
- This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to udpate it in one place. For example:

```JAVASCRIPT
class FlavorForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: 'coconut'};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('Your favorite flavor is: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    render (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Pick your favorite flavor:
          <select value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}>
            <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
            <option value="lime">Lime</option>
            <option value="coconut">Coconut</option>
            <option value="mango">Mango</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```

- Overall, this makes it sot hat `<input type="text">`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` all work very similarly = they all accept a `value` attribute tha tyou can use to implement a controlled component.

- NOTE: You can pass an array into the `value` attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a `select` tag:

```JAVASCRIPT
  <select multiple={true} value={['B', 'C']}>
```

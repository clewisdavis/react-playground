# React Main Concepts Notes

My notes from going through the [main concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) section of documentation.

The smallest React example looks like this:

```JAVASCRIPT
ReactDOM
    .creatRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
    .render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
```

- It displays a heading saying "hello world" on the page.
- Check out this [code pen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/MjrdWg?editors=1010) and play around with the page.

## How to read this guide

From this guide, we will go over the building blocks of React apps: elements and compnents. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.

This is a compliment guide to the [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://github.com/clewisdavis/react-playground/blob/main/React-Notes.md).

First, look at a step-by-step guid on main React concepts. Every section build on teh knowledge in earlier sections. You can learn most of React by reading the "main concepts" guide chapters in teh order they appear.

## Knowledge Level Assumptions

React is a JS library, and assume you have some basic understanding of the JS language. You can brush up on your [JS on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript). You don't want to be learning JS and React at the same time.
